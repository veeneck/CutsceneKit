/**
    A collection of CKAction objects that can be run together. Typically, you would run SKAction calls independtly from one another. For example, if you wanted to move two different nodes then you would do this:
 
        nodeA.runAction(SKAction.moveToX(500, duration:5)
        nodeB.runAction(SKAction.moveToX(500, duration:5)
 
    The downside to this is that the actions have no link to one another. If one finishes, the other doesn't care. A CKSequence is a collection of SKActions (wrapped as [CKAction]). By keeping track of the collection, we can run the different actions on different nodes at the same time. This allows for advanced functionality such as skipping / fast-forwarding a sequence of actions together. The code above would become:
 
        let sequence = CKSequence(actions: [
            CKAction(node: nodeA, action: SKAction.moveToX(500, duration: 5)),
            CKAction(node: nodeB, action: SKAction.moveToX(500, duration: 5))
        ])
 
    Given a sequence, playback can be controlled with a CKCutscene.

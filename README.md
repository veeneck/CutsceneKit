# CutsceneKit

CutsceneKit is a SpriteKit dependent framework with the goal of providing two core pieces of functionality.

- Provide an event sequence that can run any group of SKActions and allow them to be skipped.
- Add timed hooks to SKVideoNodes that allows them to be skimmed, skipped, and have dialogue overlay.

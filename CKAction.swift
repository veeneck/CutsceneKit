/**
    A container for SKActions and the nodes they should run on. Also manages the timing function that allows SKActions to be skipped. To use a CKAction, it must be added to a CKSequence, which is then controlled by a CKCutscene.
 
    - note: From a technical perspective, this imlementation is required because a bool must be set as a member variable of the SKAction. The `timingFunc` uses that state to determine when to skip an action.
 
    - precondition: If you are adding a child to `node` with a `runBlock`, you can name the child "CKActionObject" and it will automatically be removed when the action has finished.
